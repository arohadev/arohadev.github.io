<h2>Flutter.dev Free Course Notice</h2>

I visited Flutter.dev this afternoon and noted there was a new course in Flutter development that is being promoted by the Flutter team on their own homepage and which is free - yes, free. I have taken online courses from Angela at <i>The App Brewery</i> before on <i>LinkedIn Learning</i> and highly recommend her courses. She is energetic, informed and presents complex content in clear ways.

<h2>The App Brewery</h2>

This free course offers a PDF certificate on successful completion and is also part of a larger certificate. 

The course link is <a href="https://www.appbrewery.co/courses/851555">here</a>.

<h2>Reviewing Course</h2>

I might sit through this course to see if there is anything I don't already know in this space. Something for self-isolation in Aotearoa New Zealand time!
