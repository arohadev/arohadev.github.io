<h2>The Joy of Painting</h2>

I just watched the first episode of The Joy of Painting. All 13 seasons are available on YouTube and I might be going through a few of these and trying to draw along on my iPad.

Are you looking for inspiration to be creative? There is so much around to inspire, from tramping through the bush, to enjoying the joy that Bob Ross left us.

<h2>Software for Painting</h2>

There is a lot of software to help you paint, depending on your hardware. I am starting with Autodesk Sketchbook.
