<h2>App Development</h2>

The last two weeks in lock-down have given me both time to think and time to work on things that have been planned for awhile. Thinking about the difficulties others are going through, thinking about what the future might hold and lots of other things. It has been a sad thing each morning to wake up and see the increasing death toll globally.

To keep myself busy while at home, I have been developing apps and working through some data science content. Both of these things I enjoy and hope to continue during the coming months.

Keep safe!
