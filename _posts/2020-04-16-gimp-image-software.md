<h2>Open Source Image Manipulation Program</h2>

GIMP is an acronym for GNU Image Manipulation Program and I have been using it since the early 2000s. Yes, I have used Photoshop over the years, but when I am at home or working on hobbies, I always prefer GIMP. If you are looking for software that is free and which can do most image manipulation tasks, check this software out!
